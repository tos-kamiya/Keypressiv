Keypressiv
==========

A keydown-inspired markdown-based presentation tool.

* Fixted aspect ratio (1.33 (4:3) by default) against any screen resolution.
* Auto font resizing. Font sizes are relative to a screen(window).
* Easy installation. No installation required in an actual sense.
* Encourage to use markdown mixed with html. Use markdown for smiple formattings. Use html for complicated formattings.

Read [presentation.md](presentation.md) for usage,
or see this usage as [a sample presentation](http://tos-kamiya.github.io/Keypressiv/).

Slides can be converted into a PDF file (in a somehow manual way). 
Here is a sample, [presentation.pdf](presentation.pdf), which was converted from the above presentation.md.
